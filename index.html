        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global objectives adopted by all United Nations
            Member States in 2015. These goals were designed to address a wide range of global challenges, from
            eradicating poverty to combating climate change. Each of the SDGs focuses on key areas of sustainable
            development, and the third one, "Health and Well-being" (SDG3), is essential for the well-being of
            communities and global progress.</p>
